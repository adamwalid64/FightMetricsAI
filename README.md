## UFC Stats Scraper

This Python script uses Playwright to scrape detailed UFC fighter statistics from [ufcstats.com](http://www.ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters). It collects general and career-specific stats for each fighter by navigating through the website's alphabetized pages.

- Iterates through all alphabet tabs on the UFC stats page
- Collects fighter summary data: name, nickname, height, weight, stance, reach, win/loss/draw record, and belt status
- Visits each fighter's profile to extract career statistics like:
  - Strikes Landed per Minute (SLpM)
  - Striking Accuracy
  - Strikes Absorbed per Minute (SApM)
  - Striking Defense
  - Takedown Average
  - Takedown Accuracy
  - Takedown Defense
  - Submission Average
